<h1>VillagerNames Paper Plugin (1.19)</h1>

## Description
A lightweight configurable plugin which gives all unnamed villagers a chance of a randomized name. This plugin will name
villagers when right-clicked by a player, emulating a typical RPG discovery effect. You can customize all the villager
names within the config file. The profession of the villager is also displayed in the name tag. By default, villagers
are given custom names with a 33.3% percent chance. This can be changed within the plugin config file.
